## Overview
I acted as a Data Scientist for SpaceX, a private space launch company, and my main task was to apply my data science skills to analyze various datasets and gather actionable insights.

## Objectives
**1. Data Collection:** The first step was to collect raw data. I sourced data from multiple channels related to space launch activities.

**2. Data Wrangling:** After gathering the raw data, my next task was to clean and transform it. This ensured that the data was of high quality for the analyses that followed.

**3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** My instructors and I explored the cleaned data together. I used my SQL skills to query the dataset and started uncovering insights.

**4. Statistical Analysis & Data Visualization:** I applied basic statistics and data visualization techniques to get a deeper understanding of how variables interacted with each other.

**5. Data Segmentation:** To get more detailed insights, I segmented the data based on various factors or categorical variables.

**6. Predictive Modeling:** I was guided to build, evaluate, and fine-tune machine learning models, aiming to discover more interesting patterns and trends.

**7. Presentation & Storytelling:** In the end, I compiled all my analyses into a comprehensive presentation, telling the story hidden within the data.
